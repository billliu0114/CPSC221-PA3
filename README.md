# CPSC221-PA3
The inspiration for this assignment came from an article about an artist whose work recreates classic portraits with a blocky effect. The exact algorithm he used is not given in the article, but we will create similar images using a strategy for image representation that underlies common lossy image compression algorithms.
The algorithm compressed the PNG file by merging similar pixels to the same color.
